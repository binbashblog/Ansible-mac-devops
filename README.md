# ðŸ’» DevOps Mac OS automated setup 

This ansible playbook installs and sets up all the tools I need for my DevOps environment.

## ðŸš¥ Installation 

1) Clone or download this repository on your mac.

2) Execute [install.sh](install.sh)

_Note: If some Homebrew commands fail, you might need to agree to XCode's license or fix some other Brew issue. Run brew doctor to see if this is the case._

_Note2: For enabling some options and setup alias etc. I clone my dot files repo ( `.zshrc`,`.aliases`,`.gitignore_global`,...)._

_Note3: Of course you can use yours changing `dotfiles_repo` variable in `default.config.yml` file._

## ðŸš€ Usage

Just run the following command at the root of this project and enter your account password when prompted.

```sh
ansible-playbook setup-my-mac.yml -i inventory -K
```

You can customize setup editing `default.config.yml` config file.
